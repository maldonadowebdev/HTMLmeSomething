      <p>Congradulations, you've found my page. Allow me to introduce myself.</p> 
      <p>My name is <em id="name"><b>Christopher Maldonado</b></em>. I'm currently developing my web development skills (that sounds redundant, but I digress).</p>
      <p>Now before these 90's graphics and effects convince you to hire me to whip up your new enterprise suite, let's take a look at all the other things I've done in my &quot;professional&quot; journey.</p>
      <p>You'll need to double-click your first icon to get the ball rolling. Rest assured that's a feature and not a bug; that's my story and I'm sticking to it!  cough* chough*.  </p>

         <h1>&#x1F950;&nbsp;Le&nbsp;Croissant&nbsp;Shop</h1>
         <p>My first job was at a small french inspired bakery franchise called Le Croissant Shop. In time we'd also add a Haagen-Dazs ice cream shop as well.</p>
         <p>I'd was promoted to Assistant Manager and was transfered to a busier location</p> 
         <p>Although the job was fun, it wasn't paying the bills and it was time to move on, so I entered the next chapter of my story...</p>

         <h1>Wireless&nbsp;Communications&nbsp;&#x1F4F1;</h1>
         <p>The jump from Food Service to Wireless was straightforward. Afterall, retail sales is retail sales. However at some point, sales stagnated and I was laid off.</p>
         <p>Thankfully, I was quickly offered another position working on the back end of the industry with a Master Dealer. In essence my customers weren't the end user, but rahter the wireless dealers who sell to the end customer.</p>
            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My jump to the wireless industry doubled my pay from food service. My jump to master dealer work doubled the pay yet again. Wonder why this paragraph is green? I'm $ure you'll figure it out.</p>

         <h1>&#x1F693;&nbsp;NYPD&nbsp;Auxiliary</h1>
         <p>Like many people in the Post-9/11 era, I decided that I wanted to do more to fulfil my sense of civic duty. And so I decided to join the ranks of 
            the NYPD and volunteer as an Auxiliary Police Officer</p>
         <p>What ensued were some of the most fun, exciting and rewarding years of my life. </p>
         <p>Alas all good things must come to an end as the saying goes and I eventually decided it was time to leave my hometown of NYC and head west to the beautiful State of Arizona.</p>

         <h1>Call&nbsp;Centers&nbsp;&#x1F3ED;</h1>
         <p>It turns out, Arizona is chock-full of Call Centers. Apparently companies realized that there's 365 days of sunshine there and no snow storms, hurricanes, 
            tornadoes or virtually any other natural disasters encountered elsewhere in the country.</p>
         <p>So I ended up working at one of our top banks and later on with a nationwide cable provider. Fun fact, not my photo but it is of one of the actuall call centers I worked at. 
            I can see where my desk was, and that's pretty cool. </p>
         <p>Call center work was not for me so I moved on to the exciting world of Aviation</p>

         <h1>&#x1F6EA;&nbsp;Aviation</h1>
         <p>My first position was as a ramp agent (Baggage Handler) at Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. Pay sucked but every now and then I'd see a child peeking through the plane 
            window and if you wave to them, their smile and excitement would power you through the week.</p>
            <p>Another Fun Fact. Not my photo, but you see the smaller jet at the bottom of the photo? Yep, I've worked that exact plane at that exact gate.</p>
         <p>In time, I moved over to the Human Resources department. Less baggage, more air-conditioning. Win-win if you ask me. </p>
         <p>Alas all good things must come to en end so I eventually moved to Pennsylvania to become a stay at home dad.</p>

         <h1>US&nbsp;Coast&nbsp;Guard&nbsp;Auxiliary&nbsp;&#x2693;</h1>
         <p>Staying home with the kids is great but it doesn't butter my biscuit. As such I decided once again to fulfill my desire to serve the greater good and I signed up for 
            the US Coast Guard Auxiliary</p>
         <p>As an Auxiliarist I have to opportunity to train and qualify for many positions to augment the US Coast Guard. I'm currently training to be qualified as a Boat Crew Member, 
            but in the meantime I work down in the Philadelphia Base (Sector Delaware Bay) where I answer phones, sign in visitors and help monitor the security cameras. </p>
